 Section 1: Sequential Computing
💡 What is it?
Sequential Computing runs tasks one after another — only one path of execution.

🍔 Real-Life Analogy
Making a sandwich by yourself:

Get bread
Add cheese
Add ham
Assemble sandwich
🧪 Code Activity: makeSandwich
Questions for Students:
What do you observe when you run the sequential sandwich-making code?
Answer: ___________

If you were to add "Spread butter" before adding cheese, how would you modify the steps?
Answer: ___________

Why is sequential execution important in some programs?
Answer: ___________

🧬 Section 2: Concurrent Computing
💡 What is it?
Tasks alternate, but don't actually run at the same time.

☕ Real-Life Analogy
Alternating between making coffee and toasting bread.

🧪 Code Activity: prepareCoffeeAndToast
Questions for Students:
What pattern did you notice when the coffee and toast preparation alternated?
Answer: ___________

How did changing the number of steps affect the alternation?
Answer: ___________

Give a real-life example (other than coffee and toast) that could be done concurrently.
Answer: ___________

🧬 Section 3: Parallel Computing
💡 What is it?
Tasks run simultaneously using multiple threads.

🪣 Real-Life Analogy
You wash dishes while a friend folds clothes at the same time.

🧪 Code Activity: parallelTasks
Questions for Students:
How did the outputs of dish-washing and clothes-folding appear?
Answer: ___________

What happened when one of the tasks took longer than the other?
Answer: ___________

Why is parallel computing useful?
Answer: ___________

🧬 Section 4: Concurrent and Parallel
💡 What is it?
Combines both strategies: parts run simultaneously, others switch tasks.

🎉 Real-Life Analogy
At a party:

You check progress (concurrent)
Two friends prep food and decorate (parallel)
🧪 Code Activity: organizeParty
Questions for Students:
How did the main thread interact with the other threads?
Answer: ___________

If you add a new task "Playlist setup," how will it affect the party preparation?
Answer: ___________

Give another real-world scenario that involves both concurrency and parallelism.
Answer: ___________

🧬 Section 5: Sequential vs. Parallel Comparison
📦 Real-Life Analogy
Packing boxes:

Alone (sequential)
With help (parallel)
Questions for Students:
What are the advantages of using threads compared to sequential packing?
Answer: ___________

When is it better to use sequential execution instead of parallel execution?
Answer: ___________

📝 Knowledge Check: Quick Quiz
Answer the following questions:

What’s the main difference between concurrency and parallelism?
Answer: ___________

Which C++ feature allows running code on multiple threads?
Answer: ___________

How can we simulate work delays in C++?
Answer: ___________

🛠️ Hands-on Challenge
Scenario:
You are simulating preparation for a school project:

You gather materials
Your friend creates slides
Another friend prints handouts
Questions for Students:
How will you implement this simulation using parallel computing with 3 threads?
Answer: ___________

List down realistic steps you would add, and how you would insert delays.
Answer: ___________

Sketch a simple plan on how you would divide tasks among threads.
Answer: ___________
